# Artificial Neural Network Persistent Homology Properties Analysis
This repository contains our code for our paper: "Determining Structural Properties of Artificial Neural Networks Using Algebraic Topology". This code transforms a trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) into a directed graph, performs the Persistent Homology computations and calculates distances across the different trained ANNs. This process is done 5 times to validate the result and reduce the variation.

## Computational Requirements
This code requires large Random Access Memory (RAM). We used a machine of 1.5TB of RAM and 128 physical processor cores.

We suggest using either a Cloud Computing Machine (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud or similar) or reducing the network capacity.
